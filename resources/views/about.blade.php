    <hr>
    <p>
        This web application is the platform for the uploading and downloading of
        digital Modules for Mater Dei College, Tubigon, Bohol. It is developed by
        the MDC Systems Administration and Development Department to provide a
        platform for the systematic exchange of learning resources and activities
        between teachers and students as a response to the new challenges arising
        from the devastation of the super typhoon "Oddette" in pursuance with
        our mission and goal of quality education despite this greatly challenging
        educational situation that we have today.
